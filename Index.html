        <h1>Phillip Makris</h1>

        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>  My name is Phillip Makris. I was born in Walnut Creek California in 1990 and grew up in Pleasant Hill CA up until moving
            to Portland OR in 2018. As a child it was no secret to my family that I possessed a very large imagination, having
            multiple "imaginery friends" and being able to entertain myself alone for hours and hours. Although I no longer keep
            in touch with those long lost imaginery friends I still find ways to be creative, being that music was ultimetely my first
            love, I made it my mission to make music that inspired me as much as the artists I grew up idolizing. Two key moments
            in my life that led to form my passion for music was the first time I heard "More than a Feeling" by Boston when I was
            8 years old and the first time I heard "The Struggle Within" by Metallica when I was 13.<br><br>

              Since then I've created songs spanning almost every genre I enjoy listening to, ranging from classical to heavy metal to
            EDM. But as much as I love making music, I found that being reliant on it financially put a lot of pressure on
            the creative process and took a lot of the inspiration and fun out of it. So I decided to take up a new
            equally creative skillset. The skillset of web development. Web development provides the same "empty platform where
            anything is possible" that making music does. And thats inspiring and exciting to me. I'm excited to see what the next
            decade of my life will bring. Hope you enjoy!
